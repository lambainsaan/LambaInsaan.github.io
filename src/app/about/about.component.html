  # `whoami`

  Hello, Rhitik here! üëãüèº


  First things first,  I use avatars for identity. Let me put a face to the name. Here is Rhitik,

  <div class="flex">

  </div>

  I am a Product Developer working w/ [CommerceIQ](https://commerceiq.ai), helping e-commerce brands increase their market
  share. Previously I have worked with [Rivet Labs](https://rivetlabs.io) as their first employee, helping brands forecasting their financials. And I started it all with another early stage startup [Skylark Drones](https://skylarkdrones.com) as a full stack intern.

  ## Keenly observing

  ### Enterprise SaaS

  All things enterprise SaaS interests me, I am heavily invested in the future of SaaS. Have big ideas too in the space. Hit me up if you want to partner on some.

  ## Giving Back

  ### Open online education

  Fun fact, I haven't graduated from a college.

  Story is,

  I joined a college, studied for an year at the college. After seeing them not teaching the stuff I wanted to learn, gave up and dropped out. Shifted back home. Used online courses to learn what I had interest in, made myself employable, and boom got employed.

  To me,
  > `degree != education`

  I am a living testimony to this statement.

  I am very thankful to various sources of open online education, super stoked for volunteering opportunities in the space. Also looking to give back when I can in big ways in this space.
